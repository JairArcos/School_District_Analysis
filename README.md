## Overview of the school district analysis :ghost:

School district analysis was built to evaluate several key metrics in order to understand and rank their performance accoding to:

- [x] Students avg grades in/avg grade per level/% who passed Maths and Reading
- [x] Budget per student/district
- [x] Type and school size based on ranges


A couple of databases were shared, data-cleaning process was completed in order to standardized format and missing values were changed to NaN to avoid further issues during analysis. Summary with all information was shared and modified according with the needs and questions that was asked.
